                    <p>
                        Welcome to <b>Shards of Beyond</b> (SOB), where realms collide and strategy is key.
                        <br/>
                        Dive into a world where mystical Units from five distinct Realms —

                        Will you align with the arcane forces of Nature,
                        the celestial bodies of the Divine,
                        or do you succumb to the abyssal depths of the Void?

                    <h2>The Objective</h2>
                    <p>
                        The goal is simple: At the end of any Turn, be the first Player to control
                        four <span class="entity">Lanes</span> on the 4 x 5 <span class="entity">Game Board</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You control a <span class="entity">Lane</span>, whether horizontal or vertical,
                        if
                        <ul>
                            <li>that Lane contains no more empty <span class="entity">Slots</span>,</li>
                            <li>
                                and if your Units in that Lane have a higher combined <span class="entity">Power</span>
                                than your Opponent's <span class="entity">Units</span>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Setup</h2>
                    <p>
                        Starting out, take all cards and sort out all <span class="entity">Terrain</span> into a separate pile.
                        <br/>
                        Sort all other cards by their Rarity and create a pile for each
                        <span class="rarity">Common</span>,
                        <span class="rarity">Uncommon</span> and
                        <span class="rarity">Rare</span> card.
                        Shuffle each of the piles and put them face-down.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Player creates their initial Deck by drawing the following random cards:
                        <ul>
                            <li>3 <span class="rarity">Rare</span> cards.</li>
                            <li>9 <span class="rarity">Uncommon</span> cards.</li>
                            <li>18 <span class="rarity">Common</span> cards.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <blockquote class="epic">
                            The Battle may start.

                    <h2>Turn Sequence</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each Player shuffles their Deck and draws their initial Hand of 6 cards.
                        You may shuffle any number of cards from their hand into their deck and draw that many new ones.
                        <br/>
                        Decide who takes their first Turn; The starting player does not draw a card on their first Turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of your Turn, you draw a card.
                        <span class="explanation">
                            If you started the game, don't draw a Card on your first turn!

                        <br/>
                        During your Turn, you may do any of the following actions:

                            <li>
                                <span class="action">Crystallize</span>: Transform a card from your Hand into a Crystal by placing it into your Crystal Zone in front of you.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="action">Play</span>: You may play a Unit by <span class="action">deploying</span> it into a Slot on the Game Board.
                                <br/>

                                        You can deploy Units either normally (face-up), or <span class="entity">buried</span> (face-down). <span class="explanation">Buried Units have no Power, but can either <span class="action">ambush</span> or be a bluff!</span>

                                        You can only play a Unit if you meet its <span class="entity">Requirements</span> by controlling fitting Crystals!

                    Card Anatomy
                    Let's break down what a card represents:
                    Name: The identity of your Unit.
                    Type(s): Each Unit may have one or more types, which can interact with card effects.
                    Realm(s): Determines which of the five Realms the card belongs to.
                    Power: The strength of your Unit, vital for controlling Lanes.
                    Rarity: Indicated by an icon—bronze circle (Common), silver hexagon (Uncommon), gold star (Rare) under the Power stat.
                    Effect: Special abilities that can turn the tide of the game.
                    Flavor Text: Immersive lore for each Unit.
                    Set Number: Identifies the card’s set for easy collection reference.
                    Crystal Requirements: The currency to deploy Units, shown by diamond-shaped symbols. For each colored Crystal, you need to have a Crystal of that Realm (color) in order to play the Card; Gray Crystals indicate that the Crystal can be of any Realm.
                    Game Flow
                    Play cards, adjust strategies on the fly, and watch as the board transforms with each move. There's no direct combat—control of the grid is managed solely through card effects and Power values.
                    Quick Tips
                    If you’re new to SOB:
                    Don’t stress over the open board space. Start at the center and expand your control from there.
                    Utilize Crystals to build resources, then deploy powerful Units to dominate Lanes.
                    Read your cards’ effects carefully; they're the key to your strategy!
                    Remember, every game is a new journey through the Shards of Beyond. Embrace the challenge and craft your path to victory!
