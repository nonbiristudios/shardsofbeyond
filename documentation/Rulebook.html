                    <p>
                        The goal is simple: At the end of any Turn, be the first Player to control
                        four <span class="entity">Lanes</span> on the 4 <i>(vertical)</i> x 5 <i>(horizontal)</i> <span class="entity">Game Board</span>.

                        There are a total of <b>9</b> Lanes; <b>4</b> vertical and <b>5</b> horizontal ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You control a <span class="entity">Lane</span>, whether horizontal or vertical,
                        if
                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                and if your Units in that Lane have a higher combined <span class="entity">Power</span>
                                than your Opponent's <span class="entity">Units</span>.
                            </li>

                        Next to each <span class="entity">Horizontal Lane</span> on the Game Board, place a random Terrain Card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grab your Deck -
