- Place a random Terrain card next to each Lane.

[Game Goal]
- Be the first player to conquer {ConqueredLanesToWin} Lanes!

[Game Start]
- Players decide on who goes first by tossing a coin.
- Each player draws {MulliganCards} cards from their deck. Once, each player may shuffle any number of cards from their hand to their deck and draw that many new ones.
- Players take turns. At the start of your turn, you draw a card.

During your turn, you do the following:
- You may crystallize a card from your hand.
-- You may play a card from your hand ("face-up") or
-- You may play a card from your hand buried ("face-down").

At the end of each turn, you take conquer ("take control of") any Lanes where | You can't conquer a Lane that you currently already conquered!
- each of its Slots is not empty
- your Units have the greatest total sum of their Power in that Lane

If you then control atleast {ConqueredLanesToWin} Lanes and your Opponent controls less Lanes, you win the game.
If you and your Opponent then both control {ConqueredLanesToWin} Lanes, the player who controls Units with the least total Power wins the game, because they outsmarted their Opponent with less Ressources.
If there then are no more free Slots, the player who controls the most Lanes wins the game.
If each player then controls the same number of Lanes, the player who controls Units with the least total Power wins the game.
If there then is still no winning player, the player who went second wins the game.


When you play a card, you need to be able to pay its Cost.
